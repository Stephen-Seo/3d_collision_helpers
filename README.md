# 3D Collision Helpers

Things to note:

- `main` is the stable branch. Expect things to not break unless the major
  version number has changed.
- `dev` is the unstable branch. Expect force pushes and rebases on this branch.
- Changes to be merged into `main` from `dev` will be done with an explicit
  merge.
